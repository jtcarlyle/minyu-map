* Review of Current State
  - The recent Minnan and Minbei data note tone classes with superscripts
  - The earlier data never used superscripts for aspiration or tone class
  - The earlier data has comments in [square brackects] that need to be scrubbed
  - There is no Akitani Funing ci data
  - Norman's Zheyang dialect /is/ the Zherong dialect.
    + The town was renamed after "liberation"
  - Some of the TSVs have a "note" field and other fields that need to be excluded
      
* Index Issues  
  - The current index only has 44 matches in the shengzhi data
    + Many of these don't match the Akitani indexes
    + However, the shengzhi data is super low quality
  - For now, I will not expand the current list. Instead
    +trim crap entries
    +redo glosses
    +add in kwok cross indexes
  - I have the shengzhi cross index somewhere. Maybe an old org in DropBox?
  - Trimmed:

* Source Issues

Shengzhi
- Very low res
- Tones are given by class in the data
- Tones values listed only for out of sandhi
- Some tones have wen/bai alternates that are not marked in the chart
- tables have grids, but no side edges
- praying this will work right

Li Rulong
- Bad organization
- Little data for surrounding dialects

* Tasks
** TODO Write script to format all current data
** TODO Attempt to get OCR to work with the 省志
** TODO Format 省志 csv data
** TODO Check 省志 transcriptions
** TODO Standardize 省志 transcriptions
** TODO Combine all data
** TODO Assess Li Rulong feasibility
